# LibraryApp
This C# console application is a Library app that allows users to log in or create new accounts, view book information, and check out books currently not on loan.


Note: If you would like to use an existing account, there are two user accounts already set up: beanieBaby and libraryAdmin. Otherwise, please create a new account. Once you create an account, you can log in using that username as long as you don't exit the application after logging out.


Requirements: 

These are the 3 features included in my project:

1) Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program

2) Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program

3) Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application
